<ArticleParagraph>
  When I work on my computer, I usually have two personalities. The first
  personality is one fo the{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>; He tries to work
  within the limits of actions prescribed by the software applications installed
  on the laptop he is using.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  My <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>personality would use
  Microsoft Excel to get information about the number of students that attended
  any event by scrolling through a long page of names. He slugs through menial
  chores involving numerous mouse clicks, switching of screens and occasional
  clumsy keyboard shortcuts. This personality is very patient and content to
  stay within the limits of whatever software he is using. He allows such
  software to dictate what he can or cannot do.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  There is the other personality, the one who believes that computers can and
  should do the boring tasks. He knows all the requirement to get computers to
  work for him is to speak the computers language.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleHeader>Why am I talking about computers and menial work?</ArticleHeader>

<ArticleParagraph>
  So a funny incident happened to me just now and I decided to write about it
  and share immediately lest procrastination deprives me of the opportunity to
  share this story which I hope might give all computer operators wondering how
  to broach the field of computer programming an incentive or a way to start.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I decided to download a file on my Mac, specifically a tar file. Everyone who
  had ever downloaded a file would intuitively try double-clicking the file in
  order to open/unzip/decompress the file, and that's what I did. However even
  after double-clicking, triple-clicking nothing worked.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  At the risk of sounding dramatic, the gist is; I didn't get the file to open
  but rather a terse note from Mac saying "There is no application set to open
  the document." Weird I thought.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  To give you context, I have never bothered about installing a separate
  application just for unzipping/decompressing files. I knew there exists a
  manifold selection of applications for unzipping files ranging from WinRar to
  WinZip.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  My <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>kicked in and decided
  to solve the problem of unzipping the file I just downloaded. He followed the
  prompt suggested by Mac. There were three choices.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleBullet
  list={[
    'Choose application [to open the file]',
    <span>
      Cancel <ArticleHighlight>duh!</ArticleHighlight>
    </span>,
    <span>
      Search App store.{` `}
      <ArticleHighlight>Are you really serious?</ArticleHighlight> ðŸ˜¡
    </span>,
  ]}
/>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Of course, I would not cancel. I was left with two other options.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Clicking on <ArticleHighlight>Choose application</ArticleHighlight> revealed a
  menu of "Recommended applications" none of which had any indication that they
  were designed to unzip files. Surprisingly, I expected to see probably the
  default Mac application that enabled me decompress{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>.zip </ArticleHighlight>files.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  At this point, I was losing my patience. Unzipping the file was not my main
  objective and It just was too ridiculous to think of having to read articles
  in order to unzip files. Searching the app store was simply out of question.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I had hit the limits of my patience and then like the prodigal son, I realized
  that I was a programmer, or at least I knew how to use the terminal/command
  prompt.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  As a programmer, when I work, I am instinctively domiciled in the command
  prompt. Whether it be navigating to a new folder, copying and pasting files,
  installing programs, renaming files, you name it ðŸ˜ƒ, I do all these in the
  terminal by typing direct commands.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Speaking of installing programs, most Unix-based laptops, i.e Mac and Ubuntu,
  have their programs packaged not in a convenient click-and-install manner like
  is conventional for windows programs. It is a common first step when
  installing a program in Mac, to decompress said compressed programs before
  installing them. All the while I installed linux programs, I had always done
  it `programmatically` in order words, by running some commands in my command
  prompt.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I decided to give the command prompt a try; and run the command that I had run
  so frequently that I could type them out without thinking.
</ArticleParagraph>

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
  {`
    $ tar -xvf stubborn_file.rar
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

<ArticleParagraph>behold the file was uncompressed.</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I would not bore you by explaining what the commands mean; suffice to say this
  is the command I used to decompress all compressed files irrespective of the
  file extension.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Why couldn't the file be unzipped using the GUI?. I wondered how much power
  has been locked away from us behind deceitful icons and buttons. I thought
  about all the popular paid applications for decompressing files and wondered
  if there was any other feature these{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>"premium"</ArticleHighlight> software offered besides
  running some simple command. I wondered if these features could justify some
  of the price tags.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  So here I was the same person facing a problem on one hand as a _Computer
  Operator_ and solving the problem on the other hand as a computer programmer.
  What change? Simply a realization that the most direct way to operate a
  computer is to give it direct instructions. By typing commands on the
  terminal, you dispense with all the indirections created by app developers
  with the good intention of providing you with{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>"friendly"</ArticleHighlight> interface and you get down to
  the raw engine.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  While working on a black screen with white text might seem intimidating at
  first, you would quickly discover that it can be quite friendly once you have
  mastered the basics and what's more? The power you will have unlocked makes
  learning the command prompt a good bargain.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  If I have not convinced you yet of the advantages of having a knowledge of the
  command prompt in your toolkit as a{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>, consider this, you
  become a <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator Pro Max</ArticleHighlight> when
  you learn the command prompt because you have a better understanding of how
  things work under the hood and this knowledge lets you transcend the
  limitations of most UI-based software.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Furthermore, you are on the porch of becoming a programmer. The fundamental
  idea of programming is the same with the idea of using the command prompt and
  this idea is simply one of learning how to communicate to computers directly
  in the language they understand.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Today, initiate, I hope you start exploring the command prompt more from here
  on.
