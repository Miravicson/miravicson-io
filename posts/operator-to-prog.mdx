<ArticleParagraph>
  When I work on my computer, I usually have two personalities. The first
  personality is one of the <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>; He tries to work
  within the limits of actions prescribed by the software applications installed
  on the laptop being used by him.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  My <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>personality would use
  Microsoft Excel to get information about the number of students that attended any event by scrolling through a long page of names. He slugs through menial chores involving numerous mouse clicks, switching of screens and, occasional clumsy keyboard shortcuts. This personality is very patient and content to stay within the limits of whatever software he is using. He allows such software to dictate what he can or cannot do.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  There is the other personality, the one who believes that computers can and should do the boring tasks. He knows all the requirements to get computers to work for him is to speak the computers language.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleHeader>Why am I talking about computers and menial work?</ArticleHeader>

<ArticleParagraph>
  So a funny incident happened to me just now so I decided to write about it and
  immediately share lest procrastination deprives me of the opportunity to tell
  this story &ndash; which I hope might give all computer operators wondering
  how to broach the field of computer programming a way and reason to start.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I decided to download a file on my Mac, specifically a tar file. Everyone who
  had ever downloaded a file would intuitively try double-clicking the file in
  order to open/unzip/decompress the file, and that's what I did. However, even
  after double-clicking, triple-clicking the file didn't uncompress.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  At the risk of sounding dramatic, the gist is; I didn't get the file to open
  but rather a terse note from Mac saying{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>
    There is no application set to open the document.
  </ArticleHighlight>{' '}
  Weird I thought.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  To give you context, I have never bothered about installing a separate application just for unzipping/decompressing files. I knew there exists a
  manifold selection of applications for unzipping files ranging from WinRar to
  WinZip.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  My <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>kicked in and decided to solve the problem of unzipping the file I just downloaded. He followed the prompt suggested by Mac. There were three choices.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleBullet
  list={[
    'Choose application [to open the file]',
    <span>
      Cancel <ArticleHighlight>duh!</ArticleHighlight>
    </span>,
    <span>
      Search App store.{` `}
      <ArticleHighlight>Are you really serious?</ArticleHighlight> ðŸ˜¡
    </span>,
  ]}
/>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Of course, I would not cancel. I had only two viable options.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Clicking on <ArticleHighlight>Choose application</ArticleHighlight> revealed a
  menu of "Recommended applications" none of which had any indication that they
  were designed to unzip files. Surprisingly, I expected to see probably the
  default Mac application that enabled me decompress{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>.zip </ArticleHighlight>files.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  At this point, I was losing my patience. Unzipping the file was not my main objective and It just was too ridiculous to think of having to read articles in order to unzip files. Searching the app store was not an option.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I had hit the limits of my patience. Like the prodigal son, I realized that I was a programmer, or at least I knew how to use the terminal/command prompt.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  As a programmer, when I work, I am instinctively domiciled in the command prompt. Whether it be navigating to a new folder, copying and pasting files,
  installing programs, renaming files, you name it ðŸ˜ƒ, I do all these in the terminal by typing direct commands.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Speaking of installing programs, most Unix-based laptops, i.e Mac and Ubuntu,
  have their programs packaged not in a convenient click-and-install manner like is conventional for windows programs. It is a common first step when installing a program in Mac, to decompress said compressed programs before installing them. Whenever I installed Linux programs, I always installed it <ArticleHighlight>programmatically</ArticleHighlight>. In order words, by running some commands in my command prompt.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I decided to give the command prompt a try, and run the command that I had ran so frequently that I could type them out without thinking.
</ArticleParagraph>

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
  {`
    $ tar -xvf stubborn_file.rar
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

<ArticleParagraph>behold the file was uncompressed.</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I would not bore you by explaining what the commands mean; suffice to say that I run the above command to decompress all compressed files irrespective of the file extension.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Why couldn't the file be unzipped using the GUI?. I wondered how much power have been locked away from us behind deceitful icons and buttons. I thought about all the popular paid applications for decompressing files and wondered if there was any other feature these{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>"premium"</ArticleHighlight> software offered besides running some simple command. I wondered if these features could justify the price tags.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  So here I was, the same person facing a problem, on one hand, as a{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight> and solving the problem
  on the other hand as a computer programmer. What change? Simply a realization that the most direct way to operate a computer is to give it direct instructions. By typing commands on the terminal, you dispense with all the indirections created by app developers with the good intention of providing you with <ArticleHighlight>"friendly"</ArticleHighlight> interface and you get down to the raw engine.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  While working on a black screen with white text might seem intimidating at first, you would quickly discover that it can be less intimidating once you have mastered the basics and what's more? The power you will have unlocked makes learning the command prompt a good bargain.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  If I have not convinced you yet of the advantages of knowledge of the command
  prompt in your toolkit as a{' '}
  <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator</ArticleHighlight>, consider this, you
  become a <ArticleHighlight>Computer Operator Pro Max</ArticleHighlight> when
  you learn the command prompt because you have a better understanding of how
  things work under the hood. This knowledge lets you transcend the limitations
  of most UI-based software.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Furthermore, you are on the porch of becoming a programmer. The fundamental
  idea of programming is the same as the idea of using the command prompt. This
  idea is simply one of learning how to communicate to computers directly in the
  language they understand.
</ArticleParagraph>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Today, initiate, I hope you start exploring the command prompt more from here
  on.
