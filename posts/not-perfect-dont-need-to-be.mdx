<ArticleParagraph>
A few pages into reading<ArticleHighlight>Steve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson</ArticleHighlight> and I couldn&apos;t help but ponder on how the idea of a perfect human is deeply flawed.

Having this knowledge could, for instance, empower one to forgive oneself and equally forgive others. To those who have held themselves back by inordinate feelings of inadequacy, accepting this knowledge could encourage them to dispel such limitations and further propel them to pursue their dreams and lead their best lives.

How liberating is it realising that one can get into that dream job; because that role is not reserved for perfect people; because perfect people don&apos;t exist?

<ArticleParagraph>
It&apos;s a simple yet profound message that we are not perfect, we don&apos;t need to be, and we lose nothing by not being perfect.
