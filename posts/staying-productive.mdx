<ArticleHeader>Getting the domestics out of the way</ArticleHeader>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Since I am work from home, it is usually always tempting to skip breakfast and
  a shower and just dive right into working from bed. Although I have succumbed
  to this a few times, my most productive days are the days I start by having
  breakfast, having a shower and dressing up. This sets the tone for my day.

<ArticleHeader>Organize my work landscape</ArticleHeader>

<ArticleParagraph>
  I take a look at my Jira board to get a general overview of tasks that I am to
  work on paying attention to the priority of the tasks. Often I might recognize
  that some tasks or features might require further clarifications and
  elaborations, I make note of such tasks to schedule a meeting with my pm to
  seek necessary clarifications. I am found that I am most motivated when I can
  organize my tasks into tangible well-defined goals.

<ArticleHeader>We are not meant for monotonous tasks</ArticleHeader>

<ArticleParagraph>
  Programming can be boring, what's not boring is achieving goals and getting a
  reward for yourself. Leaning on the goals I have created, I break my work
  times into chunks of about an hour and a half punctuated with 15 mins breaks.
  These 15 minutes breaks are recreational time that I utilize to reward myself
  for staying focus. I use these times to check Instagram, Watch a YouTube video
  or catch up on highlights of previous matches. And then repeat. I have found
  that the variety of activities within the time slot helps eliminate boredom
  for me and keeps me pumped and productive.
