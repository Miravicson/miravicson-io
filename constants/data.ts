  about: {
    title: `For over half a decade, I have groomed my technical expertise while providing value for several companies. I have worked in a fast-paced fintech startup as a champion for the application of Internal tools; I have worked in a travel agency company to build intuitive applications to help users plan their itineraries. I took my part in aiding businesses to drive up their customers by managing and maintaining a backend application for a company that runs a campaign management solution. In all these companies, I worked as a Full-stack developer developing the APIs and User Interfaces using TypeScript/JavaScript, React, NodeJs, and GraphQL and associated technologies.`,
    description: [
      `While working in a startup company, I learned how to walk the fast-paced hallways of most startups. I learned to be calm under pressure, to understand when to take proper initiative about a problem, and to maximise the aid of teammates and stakeholders in proffering solutions to problems. I learned to make informed compromises between time and feature when on a deadline and how to ask the right questions to guarantee that my actions and work as an engineer aligns with business goals.`,
      `Effective communication is an essential ingredient that aids success while working remotely. In four years of working remotely, I have learned to communicate preemptively; manage my time and make personal adjustments to my schedule that allows me effectively to cope with the timezone differences. I appreciate the value of transparency in promoting trust and reliability from working with colleagues and teammates across multiple time zones.`,
      `I have had on-the-job experiences with core technology best practices such as Test-driven development, Continuous Integration/Continuous development -- essentially the state-of-the-art practices that seek to keep the code base clean and maintainable. For any deficiencies in technical knowledge, I compensate by being curious. I read technical articles and seek opportunities to learn new skills; challenge existing skills; and, in my way, make my work enjoyable and rewarding.`,
      `The solutions I have built have enabled real-time monitoring of transaction flow, easy and efficient creation, tracking, and resolution of financial issues. With some of the APIs and Dashboard I have built, I have empowered customers to resolve issues themselves on their phones. Because I am passionate about users having the best experience, I developed an Intelligent system that automatically classifies issue tickets and resolves them as soon as they are logged.`,
      `In summary, I have a delightful mix of technical skills, soft skills, experiences, and success stories that have prepared me to apply my best while working for your team.`,
