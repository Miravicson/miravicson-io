    "title": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Victor â€” a full-stack software engineer and digital problem-solver since 2018.",
    "description": [
      "From a quiet corner of Nigeria, Iâ€™ve spent over half a decade helping companies ship real products that solve real problems â€” with code, coffee, and curiosity. My journey began in 2018, and ever since, Iâ€™ve been building systems that are both elegant under the hood and intuitive on the surface.",
      "At **Kudi (now Nomba)**, a blazing-fast fintech startup, I was the resident internal tooling sorcerer. I led the development of internal applications that empowered 300+ support and operations staff to manage and resolve financial issues in record time. I built reusable component libraries using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**, and architected robust backends with **NestJS**, **GraphQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**.",
      "One of my proudest feats? An **automated issue resolution system** that classified and solved user-reported issues the moment they were logged â€” no human needed. I also built notification systems, unified dashboards for transaction tracing, and workflows that made escalations as smooth as butter. It was backend engineering with a front-row seat to real-world impact.",
      "Before that, I was at CloudPro in the travel-tech world, building web portals that helped users plan bookings, apply for visas, and manage trips with ease. I created customer-facing interfaces using **React** and handled RESTful services in **Express** â€” integrating APIs for hotels, flights, and beyond.",
      "Iâ€™ve also dipped my toes into marketing tech â€” helping brands manage, monitor, and automate digital campaigns. Think custom dashboards, background jobs, campaign analytics, and performant APIs all built with care and precision.",
      "Across the board, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **Prisma**, **Supabase**, **Redis**, **Jest**, **Playwright**, **Storybook**, **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and even explored **Rust** for performance-critical experiments.",
      "Remote work? Been there, done that, and thrived. I've collaborated with globally distributed teams, wrangled timezones, and mastered asynchronous communication. Think Slack etiquette, calendar-fu, and plenty of well-crafted Notion docs.",
      "Today, I'm building **Bloomers**, a health-tech platform revolutionizing maternal and child healthcare in Nigeria. Bloomers offers home-delivered vaccines, virtual consultations, and community support, ensuring that mothers and their children receive convenient and accessible healthcare services. I'm bringing my fintech-hardened skillset to this vital sector â€” and loving every bit of it.",
      "In the end, Iâ€™m all about building thoughtful systems â€” ones that scale, solve real problems, and make peopleâ€™s lives better. With a solid grasp of both frontend polish and backend power, I aim to build software that doesnâ€™t just work â€” it *blooms*."
