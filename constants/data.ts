    title: `I am a Senior Full-Stack Developer at Kudi.com. I lead the design and development of Internal Tools used to empower my colleagues to be productive. I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. In my spare time, you would find me training an AI model or trying to beat my record score on Kaggle.`,
    description: [
      `The solutions I have built have enabled real-time monitoring of transaction flow, easy and efficient creation, tracking, and resolution of financial issues. With some of the APIs and Dashboard I have built, I have empowered customers to resolve issues themselves on their phones. Because I am passionate about users having the best experience, I developed an Intelligent system that automatically classifies issue tickets and resolves them as soon as they are logged.`,
      `I have a wealth of tech background. I was the geeky Electronic Engineering student, who often was seen fiddling with a micro-controller or an actuator or thinking about how everything could be made a node in an Internet of Things network. As an AI developer and Intel Innovator, I have gained a significant level of experience from leading and teaching a community of AI developers. I have acquired senior-level experience on full-stack technologies over about six years. In these years, I have embraced challenging problems and learned the beautiful art of building APIs that work and are well documented and tested alongside the art of building pixel-perfect intuitive user interfaces that keep users engaged.`,
      `Recently, I have taken an Interest in the iOS and macOS ecosystems. I find the technologies elegant and the Apple community helpful. Needless to say that I have been very productive and my learning experience has been fun and fast. I can't wait to share exciting iOS and MacOS applications I will be building with you. 
Do stay tuned to the articles page, you will be glad you did.`,
